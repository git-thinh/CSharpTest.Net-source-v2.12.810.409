===Library History===
*2.12.810.409*

NOTES:  Major version increment primarily due to extensive changes in BPlusTree's capabilities and storage format.  The next release will flag the v1 Options class as Obsolete to ensure people are using the latest version.  All new code should be using 'OptionsV2' when constructing a BPlusTree.

Additions in this release:

  # Added BPlusTree.OptionsV2 to provide a more simple set of options and uses the v2 file format.
  # BPlusTree now supports key range enumeration as well as accessing first/last key in the tree.
  # BPlusTree now supports optimized AddRange and BulkInsert methods.
  # BPlusTree now supports transaction logging for improved durability and recovery.
  # BPlusTree now has a completely new file format (use the OptionsV2 class) for improved performance and reliability.
  # The generator's ResXtoMC complier now supports application manifest files and the inclusion of win32 resource files.
  # Added the IConcurrentDictionary interface to provide an abstraction on concurrent dictionary implementations.
  # BPlusTree now supports all relevent members of the .NET ConcurrentDictionary class and implements IConcurrentDictionary.
  # Updated SynchronizedDictionary to implement IConcurrentDictionary, great for testing code without a BPlusTree backend.
  # Added BTreeDictionary<TKey,TValue> to support in-memory always sorted key/value dictionary.
  # Added BTreeList<T> to support an in-memory B+Tree backed sorted list.
  # Added collection classes to deal with KeyValue comparision, ordering, enumerating, etc.
  # Added MergeSort (stable sorting) static class for more efficient sorting with custom comparer implementations.
  # Added an alternative to FragmentedFile called TransactedCompoundFile to support the rewite of the BPlusTree file format.
  # CmdTool.exe now supports a boolean 'stop' attribute on the FileMatch tag, allowing complete override of files that appear higher in the folder structure.


Fixes in this release:

  # XmlLightElement CDATA handling was incorrectly decoding html content.
  # OrdinalList had a bug in the IntersectWith and UnionWith implementations where the inputs were the same length.
  # BPlusTree enumeration of Keys or Values would load the entire tree into a list, this is now fixed.


Breaking changes in this release:

  # The following breaking changes were made to BPlusTree to bring it's concurrent interface members inline with .NET 4's ConcurrentDictionary.
    * BPlusTree changed the delegate type provided to TryUpdate to include both Key and Value.
    * BPlusTree changed the method name and delegate type of Add(TKey, delegate) to TryAdd(TKey, delegate).
    * BPlusTree changed the delegate types provided to AddOrUpdate to include both Key and Value.
  # BPlusTree.Options is still backwards compatible with existing files; however, BPlusTree.OptionsV2 uses a new format.


*v1.11.924.348*

Minor update release:

  # Addition of Cyrpto.SecureTransfer to provide file transfers via shared public keys.
  # The Crypto.AESCryptoKey now has ToArray() and FromBytes() like other keys.
  # HashStream can now aggregate read/write calls to actual storage stream while computing the hash.
  # The Crypto.Hash class received a new method, Combine(...)
  # Html.XmlLightElement and related classes are now fully modifiable.
  # BPlusTree.Options now supports a ReadOnly property to ensure no writes at the file handle level.

  # IO.[http://csharptest.net/browse/src/Library/IO/StreamCache.cs StreamCache] a pool of open file streams that a thread can open and close without the overhead of actually opening or closing the underlying file streams.
  # Interfaces.[http://csharptest.net/browse/src/Library/Interfaces/IFactory.cs IFactory] provides a simple generic factory interface for supplying instances of type T.
  # Interfaces.[http://csharptest.net/browse/src/Library/Interfaces/ITransactable.cs ITransactable] provides a simple transaction interface.
  # IpcChannel.[http://csharptest.net/browse/src/Library/IpcChannel/IpcEventChannel.cs IpcEventChannel] provides a cross domain/process connectionless communication built on events.  [http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5007247/finding-or-building-an-inter-process-broadcast-communication-channel see this SO post].
  # Serialization.[http://csharptest.net/browse/src/Library/Serialization/ISerializer.cs ISerializer] provides a simple interface for an object that can read and write an instance of type T to and from a stream.
  # Serialization.[http://csharptest.net/browse/src/Library/Serialization/PrimitiveSerializer.cs PrimitiveSerializer] provides basic implementation of the ISerializer interface for the primitive types.
  # Serialization.[http://csharptest.net/browse/src/Library/Serialization/VariantNumberSerializer.cs VariantNumberSerializer] provides a protobuffer-like encoding for numeric types.

  # Threading.[http://csharptest.net/browse/src/Library/Threading/WaitAndContinueWorker.cs WaitAndContinueWorker] a single worker thread that processes a WaitAndContinueList.
  # [http://csharptest.net/browse/src/Library/Threading/WorkQueue.cs WorkQueue] and [http://csharptest.net/browse/src/Library/Threading/WorkQueue.cs WorkQueue] provide simple thread pool processing of tasks that the caller can wait for completion on.
  # Utils.[http://csharptest.net/browse/src/Library/Utils/ObjectKeepAlive.cs ObjectKeepAlive] a simple object to track references to other instances to avoid garbage collection.
  # Utils.[http://csharptest.net/browse/src/Library/Utils/WeakReference.cs WeakReference] a derivation of WeakReference that is type-safe.
  # [http://csharptest.net/browse/src/Library/Synchronization Synchronization] classes are newly rewritten.


Breaking changes in this release:

  # The [http://csharptest.net/browse/src/Library/Synchronization Synchronization namespace] has undergone a complete overhaul.  If your currently depending upon it's interfaces or implementation you may want to stay with the version you have until you can determine the impact.  Some simple uses of the previous classes may still work, but this a complete rewrite.  Why?  Simply put the last version was junk.  The added cost of the abstraction layer was more than the lock itself.  I've retooled it to avoid new instances on lock, removed the use of TimeSpan, removed the upgrade locks, and simplified the interfaces.  The end result is a very clean interface that is easy to use and fast.
